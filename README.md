## Comprehensive Forzium Project Audit

### Scope of Review and Key Components

> To verify that Forzium meets its goals, we examined all critical components of the main branch:

* **Rust Engine (`core/rust_engine`)**
  Includes the custom HTTP server (replacing Uvicorn), validation engine (replacing Pydantic), and memory management. Reviewed down to line-level.

* **Python API Layer (`core/python_api`, `forzium/`)**
  Python bindings exposing Rust logic – includes route registration, request/response handling, orchestration.

* **Bindings & Integration (`interfaces/`, PyO3 usage)**
  Rust ↔ Python glue code. Ensures FastAPI compatibility and memory safety across language boundaries.

* **External Dependency Removal**
  Confirmed FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, etc. are fully removed or replaced.

* **Testing & Benchmarks**
  Unit, integration, and performance tests confirm correctness and performance gains.
