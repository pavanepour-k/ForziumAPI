# Developer Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation for developers working on or contributing to ForziumAPI.

## Documentation

### Technical References
- **[Architecture](architecture.md)** - System architecture, design principles, and technical implementation details
- **[Performance Baseline](performance_baseline.md)** - Performance benchmarks, metrics, and regression testing
- **[Enterprise Adoption](enterprise_adoption_note.md)** - Enterprise deployment processes and governance requirements
- **[Normalization Rules](normalization_rules.md)** - Data normalization guidelines for testing and QA

## For Contributors

These documents are intended for:
- **Core Developers**: Working on the ForziumAPI framework itself
- **QA Engineers**: Testing and validation procedures
- **DevOps Engineers**: Deployment and infrastructure concerns
- **Enterprise Architects**: Large-scale deployment planning

## User Documentation

For end-user documentation, see the main [README](../README.md) and [User Guide](../USER_GUIDE.md) in the parent directory.

## Getting Started as a Developer

1. **Read the Architecture**: Start with [architecture.md](architecture.md) to understand the system design
2. **Review Performance**: Check [performance_baseline.md](performance_baseline.md) for performance expectations
3. **Understand Testing**: See [normalization_rules.md](normalization_rules.md) for testing procedures
4. **Enterprise Deployments**: Review [enterprise_adoption_note.md](enterprise_adoption_note.md) for enterprise considerations

## Contributing

When contributing to ForziumAPI:
- Follow the architecture patterns described in the documentation
- Ensure performance doesn't regress below baseline metrics
- Update relevant documentation when making changes
- Follow the testing procedures outlined in the normalization rules
