## Migration Guide

### From FastAPI
If you're migrating from FastAPI, the process is straightforward:

1. **Replace imports**:
   ```python
   # Before (FastAPI)
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   
   # After (ForziumAPI)
   from forzium import ForziumApp
   ```

2. **Update app creation**:
   ```python
   # Before
   app = FastAPI()
   
   # After
   app = ForziumApp()
   ```

3. **Everything else stays the same!** Your routes, dependencies, and middleware work exactly as before.

### Version Compatibility
- **Python**: 3.12
- **Dependencies**: Compatible with existing FastAPI dependencies
- **Migration Time**: Usually less than 5 minutes
